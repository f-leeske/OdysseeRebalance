The mod has way higher lategame stats/levels than the base game, so the original LP costs don't really suit it. 
This rebalancing includes
- Reduced LP costs late game by changing the thresholds for increased LP costs
- Increased XP for all quests
- Lowered XP gain for kills to compensate
- Fixed LP cost for learning skills across LP cost thresholds (e.g. 36 + 5 str costs 6 LP now)
- Permanent bonuses can now be used immediately and won't be taken into account to calculate the LP cost for skills and talents
